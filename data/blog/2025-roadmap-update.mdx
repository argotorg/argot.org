At Argot, we are building the critical infrastructure for Ethereum applications. Our mission is to develop and maintain core programming languages and tooling that make application development safe and resilient.

2025 has already been a landmark year: we incorporated as a non-profit Swiss association, secured initial funding, and relaunched our website. Having set up the administrative foundation, we can now prioritise what we do best - building infrastructure - and dedicate more attention to securing sustainable long-term funding.

This blog post covers six critical projects spanning programming languages, developer tooling, and formal verification. In the following you will learn about what is coming for the rest of 2025.


# Programming Languages

## Solidity
[Github](https://github.com/argotorg/solidity) | [Socials](https://x.com/solidity_lang) | [Website](https://soliditylang.org/) 

As Ethereum's primary smart contract language celebrates its 10th anniversary, Solidity continues balancing innovation with the stability that billions of dollars in smart contracts depend on. The project is currently developing Core Solidity, the next iteration of the language, which will eventually become Solidity 1.0. It will enable rapid feature development while maintaining a lean, stable foundation. Within 5-10 years, we aim to make the verification of contract correctness easier and a more common practice.

Below you will find Solidity’s 2025 roadmap, though community input will shape what comes next. As Solidity reaches its 10-year mark and we transition organizationally, we are reassessing years of accumulated feature requests alongside our overarching goals. While our focus is still on the stabilization of the language and code generation pipeline, we are exploring shorter-term solutions for immediate pain points in parallel. We will soon publish a "roadmap wishlist" covering these features, their feasibility, and trade-offs.

### Recent Milestones

* Released [v0.8.30](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2025/05/07/solidity-0.8.30-release-announcement).
* Added support for custom storage layouts.
* Introduced initial ethdebug support.
* Implemented experimental EOF support in collaboration with the Ipsilon team. 
* Initial work on the experimental SSA CFG IR pipeline. The pipeline works with control-flow graphs of Yul code in static single-assignment form and is meant to address the performance issues of the Yul optimizer and Yul->EVM transform.
* Initiated Project GreY in collaboration with the researchers from University of Madrid, aiming to improve the efficiency of the Yul->EVM transform.
* Released [results](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2025/04/25/solidity-developer-survey-2024-results/) of the 5th annual Solidity Developer Survey.

**Team notes:**

* As Solidity joined Argot as a new home for core Ethereum infrastructure, much of 2025 was dedicated to preparing for Argot's successful launch.
* Daniel Kirchner, former team lead, is currently on sabbatical. Updates on his future involvement will follow.
* Aligned with Argot's non-hierarchical approach, every experienced team member operates with substantial autonomy. Kamil Śliwak, formerly Solidity co-lead, serves as project facilitator during this transition.

### 2025 Roadmap

***Q3*** 
* SSA-CFG-based Yul backend with memory spilling.
* Differential fuzzing of the SSA CFG backend with HEVM.
* Switch to numerical AST node IDs in Yul for better optimizer performance and to prevent recurring bytecode reproducibility issues.
* Support for constants and erc7702() helper in storage layout specifiers.
* Official Linux binaries for ARM architecture.
* Metadata improvements and extra output for source code verification.
* Feature deprecations in anticipation of the next breaking release (0.9.0).

***Q4***

## Fe & Sonatina
Fe [Github](https://github.com/argotorg/fe) & Sonatina [Github](https://github.com/fe-lang/sonatina) | [Socials](https://x.com/official_fe) | [Website](https://fe-lang.org/) | [Community](https://https//fe-lang.zulipchat.com/)

Fe represents Argot’s experimental, forward-looking language efforts, combining Rust-like syntax with advanced type system features. Its backend, Sonatina, focuses on aggressive optimization to produce high-performance, verifiable EVM bytecode. Together, they aim to provide developers with a next-generation toolchain that is expressive, performant, and verifiable.

Fe’s main objective is to complete the foundational high-level language features that serve as prerequisites for v2 code generation, while delivering comprehensive CLI and language server tooling. In parallel, Sonatina’s focus is to ship a production-ready v1 backend fully integrated into the Fe toolchain, while advancing foundational R&D on a VSDG + separation-logic IR (v2) that scales beyond the EVM and enables precise reasoning about contract state and side-effects.

### Recent Milestones

* Complete Fe v2 parser/analysis rewrite.
* Built-in core library with improved type/path resolution improvements.
* Enhanced pattern-matching diagnostics.
* Asynchronous language server rewrite with TCP support.
* Expanded editor support (VSCode, Zed, Neovim).

### 2025 Roadmap

***Q3 (Fe)***
* Enable trait-associated type definitions and type projections.
* Support loading libraries from local paths and remote git urls.

***Q4 (Fe)***
* Language server improvements (code completion, refactoring features.
* Core/standard library with essential data structures and EVM-specific utilities.
* Comprehensive v2 documentation.
* Actor/message-passing model with draft syntax and semantics.
* Algebraic effects prototype for side effect management and capability-based security.

***Q3–Q4 (Sonatina)***
* Complete v1 code-generation phase with full CI coverage.
* Finish e-graph optimisation for v1 including integration of the equality-saturation engine to perform common-sub-expression elimination, algebraic simplifications, and peephole rewrites before lowering.
* Merge v1 into the Fe compiler behind --backend sonatina flag, publish release-candidate builds, and gather feedback from early adopters.
* Advance v2 IR based on VSDG separation logic for enhanced effect/capability tracking and cross-target viability.

# Developer Tooling

## Sourcify 
[Github](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify) | [Socials](https://x.com/sourcifyeth) | [Website](https://sourcify.dev/) 

Sourcify has transformed smart contract verification, growing from 5.1M verified contracts in August 2024 to 8.5M by August 2025. The project aims to play the coordinator and builder role to create an open, decentralized, and dynamic smart contract verification ecosystem, powered by open-source tools, accessible datasets, and shared standards. Its mission is to strengthen the EVM tooling landscape while upholding Ethereum’s core values of transparency and trustlessness.
