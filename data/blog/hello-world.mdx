# Argot Collective

Argot Collective is a non-profit, democratically organised, research and development collective focused on maintaining free and independent software related to Ethereum.

We believe that Ethereum's development requires dedicated people focused on its core infrastructure, working free from commercial pressures and supported by long-term funding. Our mission is to provide a positive environment for these individuals, fostering the sustainable maintenance of free, open software over an extended period.

## Governance

We believe that traditional authoritarian structures, beyond being inefficient, fundamentally conflict with our core values; we intend to operate in an entirely non hierarchical and fully democratic manner. Members have a high level of autonomy regarding day-to-day operations, and contentious decisions are settled via voting, with each member holding an equal share in the decision-making process. This lack of hierarchy is reflected in our salary structure: all members are paid the same hourly rate.

Our governance structure is adapted from the framework implemented at the [Enspiral Foundation](https://handbook.enspiral.com/). A detailed overview is publicly available [here](www.example.com).

## Transparency

We are commited to operating in a highly transparent manner, this means that we expect to publish:

- detailed financials and budgets
- roadmaps
- governance frameworks
- governance decisions
- documentation


## Team

We are a small group of around 20 former Ethereum Foundation employees, specializing as compiler engineers, verification experts, and programming language theorists. Taken together, we have a long track record of delivering high-quality public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

If you are interested in working together, either as a full member, or via grants funding, please reach out at work@ethlts.org.

## Funding

We have been seeded with a large grant from the Ethereum Foundation. We expect this to cover our needs for the next 5-10 years. We hope to achieve long term sustainability via a combination of staking income and grants.

We currently work on the following projects:
