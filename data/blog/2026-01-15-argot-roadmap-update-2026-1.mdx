This post is our bi-annual roadmap update and forward-looking outlook.

Argot is an independent non-profit organization and the largest spin-out of the Ethereum Foundation. We independently advance Ethereum’s core programming languages and developer tooling, with a mandate centered on long-term stewardship and sustainability.

A significant share of capacity in 2025 was allocated to establishing Argot’s administrative and organizational foundations, making it a year of reorganization and long-term positioning. This impact was felt most strongly within the Solidity team, where constrained capacity extended well into the second half of the year, with momentum fully returning toward year-end.

With organizational structures now in place and teams rebalanced, Argot is entering 2026 with a clear direction and renewed execution capacity.
In the sections that follow, we recap the work delivered across the collective and provide an outlook extending into the first half of 2026.

This roadmap update covers Argot’s six core projects across programming languages, developer tooling, and formal verification.

# Programming Languages:

## Solidity

[Github](https://github.com/argotorg/solidity) | [Socials](https://x.com/solidity_lang) | [Website](https://www.soliditylang.org/)

Over the past months, the Solidity team has focused on articulating its current priorities and the long-term direction of the language in greater detail [^road-to-core][^core-deep-dive]. With this direction now clearly defined, the next six months are focused on executing at full speed against the outlined plan.

[^road-to-core]: [The Road to Core Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2025/10/21/the-road-to-core-solidity/)

[^core-deep-dive]: [Core Solidity Deep Dive](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2025/11/14/core-solidity-deep-dive/)

Near-term work is centered on backend modernization. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver a functional but still experimental SSA-CFG pipeline, alongside initial improvements addressing long-standing issues such as stack-too-deep errors and compiler performance bottlenecks. Stabilization and production hardening will begin in Q2 and continue beyond, as the new pipeline matures.

In parallel, Core Solidity continues to take shape as the language’s future foundation, enabling faster language development, stronger correctness guarantees, and more accessible formal verification over a longer time horizon.

## Fe

[Github](https://github.com/argotorg/fe) | [Socials](https://x.com/official_fe) | [Website](https://fe-lang.org)

We believe that language diversity and language research are essential to building safer systems. Fe is our exploration of that belief: a statically typed EVM language designed to make side effects explicit, prevent bugs before they happen, and pair a modern developer experience with a strict safety model.

Fe offers a batteries-included toolchain and a Rust-inspired syntax tailored for smart contract development. It serves as a secure foundation for experimenting with new language ideas aimed at improving the safety and correctness of decentralized applications.

After a deliberately quiet period, Fe is now entering its next phase. The past year was spent rebuilding the language from the ground up to overcome architectural limitations and support its long-term vision. The team has laid the foundations for this work, which will materialize as Fe v2 in the first quarter of 2026.

### Q3/Q4 2025 review

**Milestones completed**

- New message-passing contract syntax and effects system
- In-progress MIR and codegen capable of compiling basic ERC20 contracts to bytecode
- Public HIR API refactor enabling static analysis, improved codegen, IDE support, and documentation tooling
- Relaunched website and documentation
- Language server with full navigation and refactoring support (find-all, go-to, hover, comprehensive renames), code completion (imports, modules, functions, methods, signature help), inlay hints, document and workspace symbols, outline and navigation, rudimentary code actions, and semantic tokens
- Code formatter available via `fe fmt` and the language server
- Support for external libraries (“ingots”) loaded from local paths or Git URLs

**In progress / nearing completion**

- std lib content

### Q1 2026

- Complete code generation support (arrays, tuples, event logging, JSON ABI generation)
- Define EVM capability and effect traits (Call, Log, Ctx)
- Complete the contract ABI abstraction
- Finalize and implement mutability and reference semantics
- Design and implement a trait-based iterator experience

- Develop non-trivial libraries (e.g., zk verifiers, Merkle trees)

### _Note on Sonatina:_

Fe v2 will continue to target Yul as its production-grade backend for the time being. As Sonatina and the Yul SSA-CFG backends mature, we plan to implement support for those as well. Some limited development on the Sonatina EVM backend will continue in the short term, and the more ambitious research (e.g. VSDG representation) will resume in the future. For now, the primary contributor to Sonatina will be focusing on the Core Solidity compiler.

**Sonatina milestones completed**

- Implement Algebraic Simplifications with egglog
- PoC work: GVN with egglog
- Memory state tracking with egglog
- Alias Analysis with egglog
- PoC work: dead-store elimination with egglog
- Multi-Block Support for egglog Optimization.
- Solidify the VSDG concept and start implementing the translation from v1 IR into VSDG based IR.

**Not achieved**

- Merge v1 into the Fe compiler behind `--backend` Sonatina flag, publish release-candidate builds, and gather feedback from early adopters.
- Complete v1 code-generation phase with full CI coverage.

# Developer Tooling

## Sourcify

[Github](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify) | [Socials](https://x.com/sourcifyeth) | [Website](https://sourcify.dev/)

Sourcify ensures verified EVM smart contract data remains open and accessible, and is powered by open-source tools.

The team has been heads down building the technical foundations of a reliable and scalable verification service. As the technical aspects mature, the team is shifting its focus to outreach, community initiatives such as [Verifier Alliance](https://verifieralliance.org/), and other areas within the Ethereum ecosystem where Sourcify has high leverage.

For further detail see [mid-2025 roadmap](https://docs.sourcify.dev/blog/roadmap-2025/) and the recent [2025 recap](https://docs.sourcify.dev/blog/recap-2025/) blog posts.

### Q3/Q4 2025 review

**Milestones completed**

- **4byte service and database:** Took over [openchain.xyz](https://openchain.xyz)'s 4byte signature service. Built the largest Ethereum signature database (7.5 million signatures) by consolidating the openchain, [4byte.directory](https://4byte.directory), [etherface](https://github.com/volsa/etherface/) data, and streaming Sourcify verified contract signatures. The service serves 7 million requests per day.
- **Public Queriable DB Instance**: Now mirroring the Sourcify database in BigQuery (listed in [Google web3 datasets](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/discover)). Can be plugged into Colab Python notebooks, or queried through GCP services. Also shipped an [AI Playground](https://sourcify.dev/#/dataset-playground) to ask LLMs questions about the dataset.
- **Contract Coverage**: The number of verified contracts reached 11 million, across 188 chains.
- **Bytecode Similarity Search**: Shipped the endpoint `/v2/verify/similarity` that finds matches for unverified contracts by looking at the previously verified contracts.
- **Verify Everywhere**
  - **Hardhat Support**: Added a PR to Hardhat for Sourcify support and parallel verification on all verifiers.
  - **Sourcify backend**: Whenever we receive a verification we submit it to all verifiers.

## ethdebug

[Github](https://github.com/ethdebug/format) | [Website](https://ethdebug.github.io/format/) | [Socials](https://x.com/ethdebug) |

The ethdebug format is a debugging data format standard for smart contracts that enables compilers to provide rich debugging information to development tools.

The past months focused on transitioning the format from specification design toward implementation. While compiler integration was delayed by the Argot spin-out's administrative demands on the Solidity team, early adopter interest, most notably from Walnut, has validated the format's direction and begun generating real-world feedback. With those constraints now easing, the coming months will focus on completing the v1 specification and deepening compiler support.

### Q3/Q4 2025 review

Progress on compiler integration was slower than planned, as Solidity team capacity was partially constrained during Argot’s organizational establishment. While the team has since resumed full execution, available bandwidth was still insufficient to advance all initiatives in parallel, including ethdebug. As administrative demands continue to wind down and the team is gradually reinforced through additional hires, engineering capacity is returning to implementation efforts.
**Milestones completed**

- New debugger [Walnut](https://walnut.dev/) has begun to support ethdebug in material ways (debugger support, framework to evaluate ethdebug output from a given compiler, initial attempt to produce ethdebug data for old solc versions)
- Reference toy compiler that produces initial ethdebug output, toy compiler ("`bugc`") playground
- Notable talk: [ethdebug format overview (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKvkXFv-GXM)

**In progress / nearing completion**

- Develop toy compiler implementation demonstrating full format

### Q1 2026

- **Schema specification**
  - Define function call semantics in program schema (enabling compilers to mark instructions as relating to function call operations)
  - Resolve pointer template variable renaming limitations

- **Compiler integration**
  - Drive Solidity integration toward feature parity with source maps

- **Debugger integration**
  - Continue collaboration with Tenderly and Simbolik (RV) on their implementations

- **Reference implementation**
  - Bring toy compiler (`bugc`) into compliance with current format specification (reference implementation serves to validate spec as it develops)

### Q2 2026

- **Schema specification**
  - Define "fancy [`pick`](https://ethdebug.github.io/format/spec/program/context/pick)" context combinator to reduce debugger disambiguation complexity
  - Extend types schema to support generic type specifications
  - Expand template system from pointer schema for use by other relevant schemas

- **Compiler integration**
  - Continue Solidity integration (priorities to be informed by Q1 progress)
  - Integrate Walnut's [ethdebug-stats](https://github.com/walnuthq/ethdebug-stats) to assess solc's ethdebug output
  - Begin monitoring Fe and Vyper for ethdebug integration feasibility

- **Debugger integration**
  - Continue collaboration with Tenderly and Simbolik (RV) on their implementations
  - Document best practices and integration guides
  - Foster collaboration with Walnut debugger
  - Outreach to Remix

# Formal Verification

## Act

[Github](https://github.com/argotorg/act) | [Documentation](https://argotorg.github.io/act/)

Act is a formal specification language and verification framework for Ethereum smart contracts and a core research effort aimed at improving smart contract safety. It bridges human-readable specifications and EVM bytecode by proving their equivalence using the hevm tool, enabling high-assurance contracts across multiple smart contract languages.

Recent work has focused on formalizing Act itself, including the development of formal semantics and proofs of type safety and soundness. With these foundations in place, the team is now preparing the first official Act v0.1.0 release, planned for early 2026.

### Q3/Q4 2025 Review

**Milestones completed**

- Formalize Act’s mathematical foundations with precise semantic definitions.

- Open source technical report with formal definitions and proofs

### Q2 2026

- Introduce game-theoretic reasoning with CheckMate tool integration for verification backend.
- Add Fe support
- Continue growth & adoption related activities

In parallel to the milestones listed above, the team will begin exploratory work to verify smart contracts written in Core Solidity.

## hevm

[Github](https://github.com/ethereum/hevm) I [Website](https://hevm.dev/)

Hevm is a specialized symbolic execution engine and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It enables developers to perform detailed analysis of contract behavior, find edge cases, and verify properties of their code through symbolic manipulation. This powerful tool helps ensure contract correctness and security.

Over the past months, the focus has been on shipping and hardening the tool, with two maintenance-focused releases delivering significant under-the-hood improvements to performance, reliability, and usability, alongside better analysis insights and user control.

Looking ahead, the focus will increasingly shift toward positioning hevm as a foundational execution engine on which other tools can be built. Echidna demonstrates the power of this model in practice, and future work will continue to strengthen hevm as a dependable core for the broader verification and testing ecosystem.

### Q3/Q4 2025 Review

**Milestones completed**

- Shipped [0.55.1](https://github.com/argotorg/hevm/releases/tag/release%2F0.55.1), [0.56.0](https://github.com/argotorg/hevm/releases/tag/release/0.56.0), and [0.57.00](https://github.com/argotorg/hevm/releases/tag/release%2F0.57.0)
- Large performance improvement of symbolic execution
  - More controlled parallelism (fewer OOMs)
  - Enhanced infeasible path pruning

  - Counterexample validation
  - Warnings mapped back to Solidity source lines
  - Better and more robust calldata decoding
  - More control over the analysis for the users (`--only-deployed`)
- RPC framework with improved performance and robustness
- Tighter integration with Echidna
  - Echidna's symbolic worker based on hevm's symbolic execution
  - Unified RPC handling

**In progress / nearing completion**

- A browser-based version of hevm with a reduced initial feature set to increase accessibility

### Q1 2026

- Osaka support: update Ethereum testing infrastructure
- Ship browser-based version of hevm
- Stateful invariant testing
- General maintenance (update dependencies)
- Continued UX improvements: additional information about explored state

### Q2 2026

- Separation of concrete and symbolic execution in the code for better performance and easier maintenance

In addition to the above listed milestones, hevm is supporting projects across the collective:

- `solc` to differentially fuzz new codegen pipelines in development (SSA-CFG pipeline)
- `act` as a backend to prove equivalence between Act specification and implementation (in e.g. Solidity & Vyper).
